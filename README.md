# NourishWell 🍴✨  
**Meal Prep, But Make It Fun and Personalized!**

## 📖 What’s This About?  

Hey there!
Welcome to **NourishWell**—your new go-to for meal plans that actually *get* you.
Whether you’re all about keto vibes, vegan living, paleo power, or gluten-free goodness, we’ve got pre-prepped meals tailored to your dietary dreams.  

Here’s the fun part: I made this during my *very first hackathon* with **zero** web development experience. Yup, I jumped in clueless but came out with a project I’m proud of (and a ton of lessons learned).
It's not perfect, but hey, that's how we grow, right? 🚀

## 🛠️ What I Used to Build It  

- **HTML**: Skeleton of the site.  
- **CSS**: Made it look nice (at least I tried!).  
- **JavaScript**: For a sprinkle of interactivity.

## 🎨 Cool Things About This Project  

1. **First Hackathon Vibes**  
   - I built this as a total noob, learning on the go. It was messy but so worth it.  
   - Fun fact: I had no idea how to center a div when I started. Progress, people!  

2. **Works on Your Phone**  
   - Because scrolling through broken layouts isn’t fun.  

3. **It’s Just Fun**  
   - Bright colors, clean layouts, and lots of good vibes.
