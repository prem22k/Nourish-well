                <p>
                  A vegan-based diet, also known simply as veganism, is a dietary approach that excludes all animal products and by-products, including meat, dairy, eggs, and honey, as well as any products derived from animals such as gelatin or certain food additives.

                  While the focus is on whole, minimally processed foods, there are also many vegan-friendly processed foods available, including plant-based meat substitutes, dairy alternatives, and packaged snacks.
