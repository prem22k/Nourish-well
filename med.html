                <p>
                  The Mediterranean diet is a dietary pattern inspired by the traditional eating habits of countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, such as Greece, Italy, Spain, and southern France. It is characterized by an emphasis on plant-based foods, healthy fats, and moderate consumption of fish, poultry, and dairy, with limited intake of red meat and processed foods.
